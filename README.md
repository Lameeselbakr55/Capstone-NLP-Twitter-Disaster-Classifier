# Capstone-NLP-Twitter-Disaster-Classifier

## **Project Overview**

This project is centered on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze social media data, specifically tweets, to distinguish between those that are related to natural disasters and those that are not.

 **The objective** 
is to preprocess the text in tweets, apply NLP techniques for analysis, and then use machine learning models to classify each tweet.

 **The aim** is to demonstrate how NLP and machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, such as enhancing disaster response mechanisms through the analysis of social media.

## **Project Goals**
* Apply NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze tweet text.
* Train various machine learning models to classify tweets as disaster-related or not.
* Evaluate the performance of these models to find the most accurate one.
* Gain hands-on experience in data analysis, modeling, and interpretation within the context of NLP and machine learning.
